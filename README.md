Extended research of 'Debiasing Vision-Language Models via Biased Prompts'

## Environment

The code has only been tested with the environment list below:
- python=3.6
- torch=1.10.1
- PIL
- diffusers
- scikit-learn
- clip
- transformers

### Conclusions

We present an extended method for removing multi-bias method

1. In general, our method remove the bias for gender and race at the same time
2. Visualize the embedding vector space and explain why the quality of the image is lower

than before
